# Catch of the Day

A seafood market app developed with [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/), as seen on [React for Beginners Course](https://reactforbeginners.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)! 👍😄

You can choose any store to start with, but as I disabled data writing at firebase, you won't be able to save anything. How can you see the app really running you ask? Use the store `jealous-lazy-tomatoes` and see some fish poping in the menu. ✨

You still can't persist fish data, but you can freely play with orders. I know, that sucks, but I plan on update somethings beyond the course to improve it. 🚧
